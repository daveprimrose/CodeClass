            <h2>Introduction to programme</h2>
            <p>
                This application will provide students with an interactive learning tool which will introduce coding and software development. Users will
                be expected to engage in lessons which will team them how to code. The application teaches students JavaScript as this is the best language to use for beginners.
                This is because it is a simple, easy to follow language that the students will enjoy using.
            </p>
            <h2>Aims</h2>
            <p>
                There is a demand for qualified Software Developers. This course is designed to raise student interest in computer programming/coding, teach new skills
                and expand on existing computing/creative skills. The programme will provide students with an interactive learning tool
                which introduces students to coding and software development. Users will be expected to engage in lessons which will teach them how to code.
                It is hoped early introduction to these skills will lead to an increase in the number of developers available in the future.
            </p>
            <h2>Who is the programme for?</h2>
            <p>
                The programme is aimed at students aged 12 - 14 years. This is assessed to be a suitable age for students to understand the curriculum and recognise and write basic code.
                The intention is to encourage younger pupils to choose computing as a national subject by providing them with the opportunity to learn coding in javascript which is not
                currently part of the school curriculum. Students will become familiar with what is expected in the national computing curriculum through this interactive learning experience.
            </p>
            <h2>Completing the Programme</h2>
            <p>
                On completion of the programme students should be familiar with writing and interpreting basic code and be able to engage in coding.
                The students will become more confident with coding and gain new computing skills while learning in a fun and relaxed environment.
                For those students who enjoy this introductory programme, next steps would be to continue to code and attempt advanced code whether it is through the school or in their free time.
            </p>
            <h2>Recommended Time</h2>
            <p>
                The programme should be delivered during one class per week until all lessons are complete. This will allow students to understand what is
                meant by coding, bcome familiar with coding and gain practical skills from the tasks they complete. Students will be able to move on to more
                complex coding and features each week and expand on the previous weeks knowledge. It is also possible for the students to complete tasks at
                home if they wish since the programme is accessible via a website. This means students can continue to learn and develop their skills from home.
                This is only a recommendation as teachers can use the programme around existing timetables at a time which is convenient for both teacher and students.
